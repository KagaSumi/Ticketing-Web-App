# Term Project

We are now moving into the section of the course where we will be building a full sized web application as a group. **The purpose of the application you are building to is create reminders, and be able to share those reminders with other users of the application.** 

First, see the image below:

![Term%20Project%20f3654a829de04034b759dd975a3e8adc/Untitled.png](Term%20Project%20f3654a829de04034b759dd975a3e8adc/Untitled.png)

Your application ***does not*** need to **look** like the image above, but it should implement a lot of the function

**Mandatory Requirements:**

**Reminder Creation (I will do a bunch of this for you to get you started)**

---

- [x]  Create a reminder
- [ ]  Delete a reminder
- [ ]  Edit a reminder
- [x]  View an individual reminder
- [x]  View all reminder

---

**Reminder Associations**

---

- [ ]  Associate subtasks with a reminder
- [ ]  Associate tags with a reminder
- [ ]  Associate a date for when you should be reminded.

---

Social Reminders

---

- [ ]  Search for other users in your application and choose to add them as a friend or not.
- [ ]  If you add them as a friend, you can see all of their reminders in your reminders list. They do not have to say yes when you add them as a friend. If you add them, they are automatically added as your friend.

**Authentication**

---

Only authenticated users should be able to see their reminders. 

- [ ]  Authenticated users should not be able to see other authenticated users reminders. Only their own.
- [ ]  Authenticated users should not be able to change other authenticated users reminders. Only their own.
- [ ]  Authenticated users should not be able to delete other authenticated users reminders. Only their own.

**You should use what you implemented in your Passport Lab in this application. You do not *have to* include Github authentication, but you MUST include at a minimum local authentication with email and password. (Local Strategy)**

---

Tasks: 

- [ ]  Distribute workload among your group members
- [ ]  Write down your name and your group member's names in the github readme:
- [ ]  Ensure all group members have watched Armaan's video lectures on building a Reminder App available on learning hub.
- [ ]  Implement the update and delete functionality in the starter file
- [ ]  Create a breakdown of work document and add it to your github. This should be called [breakdownOfWork.MD](http://breakdownofwork.MD) and inside of it, you should specify the work that you accomplished in this sprint. You will continue to update this document each week. For now, you can simply add your names to the document. At the end of the sprint, you can update it.
